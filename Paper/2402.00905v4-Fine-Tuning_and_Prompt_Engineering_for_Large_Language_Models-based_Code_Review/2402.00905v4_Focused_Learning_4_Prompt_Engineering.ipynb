    "## Mục tiêu học tập\n",
    "Hiểu sâu về prompt engineering strategies cho code review automation, dựa trên Section 3.4, RQ3 findings, và Section 5.4 của paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trích xuất từ Paper\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3.4: Inference via Prompting\n",
    "> \"*Different prompting strategies have been proposed. For example, zero-shot learning, few-shot learning [18, 30, 31], chain-of-thought [32, 33], tree-of-thought [32, 33], self-consistency [34], and persona [13]. Nevertheless, not all prompting strategies are relevant to code review automation.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"*In contrast, zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, and persona prompting are the instruction-based prompting strategies, which are more suitable for software engineering (including code review automation) tasks.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### RQ3 Results: Most Effective Prompting Strategy\n",
    "> \"*GPT-3.5 with few-shot learning achieves 46.38% - 659.09% higher EM than GPT-3.5 with zero-shot learning.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"*When a persona is included in input prompts, GPT-3.5 achieves 1.02% - 54.17% lower EM than when the persona is not included in input prompts.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 5.4: Impact of Prompt Design\n",
    "> \"*GPT-3.5 that is prompted by the prompt with a simple instruction achieves 16.44% - 45.45% higher EM than GPT-3.5 that is prompted by the prompt with an instruction being broken down into smaller steps.*\"\n",
    "\n",

    "## Lý thuyết Prompt Engineering cho Code Review\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Engineering Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Components**:\n",
    "1. **Task Definition**: Clear specification of code review task\n",
    "2. **Context Setting**: Programming language, conventions, scope\n",
    "3. **Input Format**: How to present code và comments\n",
    "4. **Output Format**: Expected structure of response\n",
    "5. **Behavioral Constraints**: What to avoid or emphasize\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Review-Specific Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unique Challenges**:\n",
    "- **Multi-modal Input**: Code + natural language comments\n",
    "- **Syntax Preservation**: Must maintain valid syntax\n",
    "- **Semantic Equivalence**: Different code, same behavior\n",
    "- **Context Dependency**: Understanding broader codebase context\n",
    "- **Style Consistency**: Following project conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paper's Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Few-shot > Zero-shot**: Dramatic improvement with examples\n",
    "2. **No Persona**: Persona actually hurts performance\n",
    "3. **Simple Instructions**: Complex step-by-step prompts are worse\n",
    "4. **Language Specificity**: Templates should acknowledge programming language"

    "2. **Keep instructions simple** and direct\n",
    "3. **Specify programming language** in context\n",
    "4. **Be explicit about output format** (\"Improved code:\")\n",
    "5. **Select relevant examples** using semantic similarity\n",
    "6. **Monitor performance** and adapt strategies\n",
    "7. **A/B test template changes** before deploying\n",
    "8. **Use consistent formatting** across examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### DON'Ts ❌\n",
    "1. **Don't use personas** (\"You are an expert developer...\")\n",
    "2. **Don't break instructions into steps** (step 1, step 2, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Don't add unnecessary constraints** or detailed requirements\n",
    "4. **Don't mix different formatting styles** in examples\n",
    "5. **Don't ignore language context** (always specify programming language)\n",
    "6. **Don't use examples from different domains** without careful selection\n",
    "7. **Don't deploy without testing** on diverse code samples\n",
    "8. **Don't assume one template fits all** use cases\n",

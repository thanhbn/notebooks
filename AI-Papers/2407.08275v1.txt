ABSTRACT
The choice of embedding model is a crucial step in the design of
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Given the sheer
volume of available options, identifying clusters of similar models
streamlines this model selection process. Relying solely on bench-
mark performance scores only allows for a weak assessment of
model similarity. Thus, in this study, we evaluate the similarity of
embedding models within the context of RAG systems. Our assess-
ment is two-fold: We use Centered Kernel Alignment to compare
embeddings on a pair-wise level. Additionally, as it is especially
pertinent to RAG systems, we evaluate the similarity of retrieval
results between these models using Jaccard and rank similarity. We
compare different families of embedding models, including pro-
prietary ones, across five datasets from the popular Benchmark
Information Retrieval (BEIR). Through our experiments we identify
clusters of models corresponding to model families, but interest-
ingly, also some inter-family clusters. Furthermore, our analysis
of top-𝑘retrieval similarity reveals high-variance at low 𝑘values.
We also identify possible open-source alternatives to proprietary
models, with Mistral exhibiting the highest similarity to OpenAI
models.

1 MOTIVATION
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging paradigm
that helps mitigate the problems of factual hallucination [ 13] and
outdated training data [ 27] of large language models (LLMs) by
providing these models with access to an external, non-parametric
knowledge source (e.g. a document corpus). Central to the func-
tioning of RAG frameworks is the retrieval step, wherein a small
subset of candidate documents is retrieved from the document cor-
pus, specific to the input query or prompt. This retrieval process,
known as dense-retrieval, hinges on text embeddings. Typically, thegeneration of these embeddings is assigned to an LLM, for which
there are several options due to the rapid evolution of the field.
Consequently, selecting the most suitable embedding model from
an array of available choices emerges as a critical aspect in the
development of RAG systems. The information to guide this choice
is currently primarily limited to architectural details (which are
also on occasion scarce due to the prevalence of closed models)
and performance benchmarks such as the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark (MTEB) [28].
We posit that an analysis of the similarity of the embeddings gen-
erated by these models would significantly aid this model selection
process. Given the large number of candidates and ever increas-
ing scale of the models, a from-scratch empirical evaluation of the
embedding quality of these LLMs on a particular task can incur
significant costs. This challenge becomes especially pronounced
when dealing with large-scale corpora comprising potentially mil-
lions of documents. While the relative performance scores of these
models on benchmark datasets offer the simplified perspective of
comparing a single scalar value on an array of downstream tasks,
such a view of model similarity might overlook the nuances of the
relative behaviour of the models [ 15]. As an example, the absolute
difference in precision@k between two retrieval systems only pro-
vides a weak indication of the overlap of retrieved results. We argue
that identifying clusters of models with similar behaviour would
allow practitioners to construct smaller, yet diverse candidate pools
of models to evaluate. Beyond model selection, as highlighted by
Klabunde et al., [ 14], such an analysis also facilitates the identi-
fication of common factors contributing to strong performance,
easier model ensembling, and detection of potential instances of
unauthorized model reuse.
In this paper, we analyze different LLMs in terms of the simi-
larities of the embeddings they generate. Our similarity analysis
serves as an unsupervised evaluation framework for these embed-
ding models, in contrast to performance benchmarks that require
labelled data. We do this from a dual perspective - we directly com-
pare the embeddings using representational similarity measures.
Additionally, we evaluate model similarity specifically in terms of
their functional impact on RAG systems i.e. we look at how sim-
ilar the retrieved results are. Our evaluation focuses on several
prominent model families, to analyze similarities both within and
across them. We also compare proprietary models (such as those byarXiv:2407.08275v1  [cs.IR]  11 Jul 2024

OpenAI or Cohere) to open-sourced ones in order to identify the
most similar alternatives. Our experiments are carried out on five
popular benchmark datasets to determine if similarities between
models are influenced by the choice of data. Our code is available
at https://github.com/casparil/embedding-model-similarity.
2 RELATED WORK
Studies evaluating similarities of neural networks fall into two
main categories: the first involves comparing activations of dif-
ferent models generated at any pair of layers for a specific input
(representational similarity), while the second compares the model
outputs (functional similarity). Raghu et al. [ 33] and Morcos et al.
[26] propose measures building on Canonical Correlation Analysis
(CCA) [ 11], a statistical technique used to find the linear relation-
ship between two sets of variables by maximizing their correlation.
Such comparisons using CCA or variants thereof can be found in
several works [ 6], [42], [4]. Beyond CCA-based measures, other
works have also explored computing correlations [ 21] and the mu-
tual information [ 20] between neurons across networks. Kornblith
et al. [ 16] propose Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), which they
show improves over several similarity measures in identifying corre-
sponding layers of identical networks with different initializations.
A diverse range of functional similarity evaluations have also been
explored in the literature. A few examples include model-stitching
[2], [18], [1], disagreement measures between output classes [ 25],
[41], and quantifying the similarity between the class-wise out-
put probabilities [ 22]. We would point the reader to the survey by
Klabunde et al. [ 15] for a detailed overview of representational and
functional similarity measures.
Recently, a few works have also focused on specifically evaluat-
ing the similarity of LLMs. While Wu et al. [ 39] evaluate language
models along several perspectives, such as their representational
and neuron-level similarities, their evaluation pre-dates the intro-
duction of the recent wave of large scale models. Freestone and
Santu [ 9] consider similarities of word embeddings, and evaluate
if LLMs differ significantly to classical encoding models in terms
of their representations. The works by Klabunde et al. [ 14] and
Brown et al. [ 3] are more recent, and evaluate the representational
similarity of LLMs, with the latter also considering the similarities
between models of different sizes in the same model family.
Much of the literature on evaluation of LLM embeddings focuses
on their performance on downstream tasks, with benchmarks such
as BEIR [ 35] (for retrieval specifically) and MTEB [ 28] providing a
unified view of embedding quality across metrics and datasets. The
metrics used here mostly include typical information retrieval met-
rics such as precision, recall, and mean reciprocal rank at certain
cutoffs. Some works specifically evaluate the retrieval components
in a RAG context, where they either use a dataset outside of those in-
cluded in the benchmarks [ 8] or where the evaluation encompasses
other aspects of the retriever beyond the embedding model being
used [ 34]. Another approach, that does not rely on ground-truth
labels, is given by the Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment
(RAGAS) framework, which uses an LLM to determine the ratio of
sentences in the retrieved context that are relevant to the answer
being generated [ 7]. To the best of our knowledge, there are noTable 1: The datasets used for generating embeddings with

works that evaluate the similarity of embedding models from a
retrieval perspective.
3 METHODS
We evaluate embedding model similarity using two approaches. The
first directly compares the embeddings of text chunks generated
by the models. The second approach is specific to the RAG context,
where we evaluate the similarity of retrieved results for a given
query. These approaches are discussed in detail in the following
sections.
3.1 Pair-wise Embedding Similarity
There are several metrics defined in the literature that measure
representational similarity [ 15]. Many of these metrics require the
representation spaces of the embeddings to be compared to be
aligned and/or the dimensionality of the embeddings across the
models to be identical. To avoid these constraints, we pick Centered
Kernel Alignment (CKA) [ 16] with a linear kernel as our similarity
measure.
The measure computes similarity between two sets of embed-
dings in two steps. First, for a set of embeddings, the pair-wise
similarity scores between all entries within this set are computed
using the kernel function. Thus, row kof the resulting similarity
matrix contains entries representing the similarity between embed-
ding kand all other embeddings, including itself. Computing two
such embedding similarity matrices for different models with the
same number of embeddings then leads to two matrices E and E’ of
matching dimensions. These are compared directly in the second
step with the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) [ 10]
using the following formula:
𝐶𝐾𝐴(𝐸,𝐸′)=𝐻𝑆𝐼𝐶(𝐸,𝐸′)√︁
𝐻𝑆𝐼𝐶(𝐸,𝐸)𝐻𝑆𝐼𝐶(𝐸′,𝐸′)(1)
The resulting similarity scores are bounded in the interval [0,
1] with a score of 1 indicating equivalent representations. CKA
assumes that representations are mean-centered.
3.2 Retrieval Similarity
While a pair-wise comparison of embeddings offers insights into
the similarities of the representations learned by these models, it
does not suffice to quantify the similarities in outcomes when these
embedding models are deployed for specific tasks. Therefore, in
context of RAG systems, we consider the similarity of retrieved text
chunks for a given query, when different embedding models are
used. As a first step, for a given dataset, we generate embeddings of

queries and document chunks with each of the embedding models.
We then retrieve the 𝑘most similar embeddings in terms of the
cosine similarity for a particular query. As these embeddings cor-
respond to specific chunks of text, we derive the sets of retrieved
chunks C and C’ for a pair of models. To measure the similarity of
these sets, we use the Jaccard similarity coefficient as follows:
𝐽𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑(𝐶,𝐶′)=|𝐶∩𝐶′|
|𝐶∪𝐶′|(2)
Here,|𝐶∩𝐶′|corresponds to the overlap in text chunks by
counting how often the two models retrieved the same chunks.
Similarly, we can compute the union |𝐶∪𝐶′|, which corresponds
to all retrieved text chunks, counting chunks present in both sets
only once. The resulting score is bounded in the interval [0, 1] with
1 indicating that both models retrieved the same set of text chunks.
While Jaccard similarity computes the percentage to which two
sets overlap, it ignores the order in the sets. Rank similarity [ 36],
on the other hand, considers the order of common elements, with
closer elements having a higher impact on the score. The measure
assigns ranks to common text chunks according to their similarity
to the query, i.e. 𝑟𝐶(𝑗)=𝑛if chunk𝑗was the top- 𝑛retrieved result
for the query. Ranks are then compared using:
𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝑟𝐶(𝑗),𝑟𝐶′(𝑗))=2
(1+|𝑟𝐶(𝑗)−𝑟𝐶′(𝑗)|)(𝑟𝐶(𝑗)+𝑟𝐶′(𝑗))(3)
With this, rank similarity for two sets of retrieved text chunks
C, C’ is calculated as:
𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝐶,𝐶′)=1
𝐻(|𝐶∩𝐶′|)∑︁
𝑗∈|𝐶∩𝐶′|𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝑟𝐶(𝑗),𝑟𝐶′(𝑗))(4)with𝐻(|𝐶∩𝐶′|)=Í𝐾=|𝐶∩𝐶′|
𝑘=11
𝑘denoting the K-th harmonic
number, normalizing the score. Like the other measures, rank sim-
ilarity is bounded in the interval [0, 1] with 1 indicating that all
ranks are identical.
4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
The following paragraphs describe our choice of datasets and mod-
els, along with details of the implementation of our experiments.
As we focus on the retrieval component of RAG systems, we
select five publicly available datasets from the BEIR benchmark [ 35].
As generating embeddings for large datasets is a time-intensive
process, especially for a larger number of models, we opt for five of
the smaller datasets from the benchmark. This approach allows us
to compare embeddings generated by a variety of models while at
the same time allowing us to evaluate embedding similarity accross
datasets. An overview of the datasets is shown in Table 1. For each
dataset, we create embeddings by splitting documents into text
chunks such that each chunk contains 256 tokens. The embedding
vectors are stored with Chroma DB [ 12], an open source embedding
database. For each vector, we additionally store information about
the document and text chunk ids it encodes to be able to match
embeddings generated by different models for evaluation.
For model selection, we primarily use publicly available models
from the MTEB leaderboard [ 28]. We do not simply pick the best
performing models on the leaderboard; instead, our choices are
influenced by several factors. Firstly, we focus on analyzing similar-
ities within and across model families and pick models belonging to
the e5 [ 37], t5 [ 29,30], bge [ 40], and gte [ 23] families. Secondly, we
recognize that it might be of interest to users to avoid pay-by-token
policies of proprietary models by identifying similar open-source al-
ternatives. Therefore, we pick high-performing proprietary models,

two from OpenAI (text-embedding-3-large and -small) [ 31] and one
from Cohere (Cohere embed-english-v3.0) [ 5]. We also compare the
mxbai-embed-large-v1 (mxbai) [ 17] and UAE-Large-V1 (UAE) [ 19]
models, that not only report very similar performances on MTEB,
but also identical embedding dimensions, model size and memory
usage. Finally, we include SFR-Embedding-Mistral (Mistral) [ 24] as
the best-performing model on the leaderboard at the time of our
experiments. A detailed overview of all selected models can be seen
in Table 2.
To compare embedding similarity across models and datasets,
we employ different strategies depending on the similarity measure.
We apply CKA by retrieving all embeddings created by a model,
matching embeddings using their document and text chunk ids and
then computing their similarity for each of the five datasets. For
Jaccard and rank similarity, we use sklearn’s NearestNeighbor class
[32] to determine the the top- 𝑘retrieval results. We compute Jaccard
and rank scores per dataset, averaging over 25 queries. For the
NFCorpus dataset, we calculate retrieval similarity for all possible
𝑘, i.e. using all embeddings generated for the dataset. As calculating
similarity for each possible 𝑘is computationally expensive, we did
not repeat this for the remaining datasets and chose a smaller 𝑘
value instead. Furthermore, as only a limited number of results
are to be provided as context to the generative model, analyzing
retrieval similarity at low 𝑘values for e.g. top-10 is of most interest.
As we are interested in identifying clusters of similar models, we
also perform a hierarchical clustering on heatmap values using
Seaborn [ 38]. The following section describes the results of our
evaluation for the different measures.

5 RESULTS
To evaluate how similar embeddings generated by different models
are, we will first consider model families, checking if their pairwise
and top-k similarity scores are highest within their family. Subse-
quently, we will identify the open source models which are most
similar to our chosen proprietary models.
5.1 Intra- and Inter-Family Clusters
Comparing embeddings directly with CKA shows high similarity
across most of the models, albeit with some variance. These scores
allow us to identify certain clusters of models. Figure 1 shows
the pair-wise CKA scores of all models averaged across the five
datasets. As expected, scores for most models are highest within
their own family. This holds true for the gtr-t5, sentence-t5 and text-
embedding-3 (OpenAI) models. Although the sentence-t5 and gtr-t5
models are closely related, they do not exhibit significantly higher
similarity with each other compared to the remaining models.
From an inter-family perspective, we observe high similarity
between the bge and gte models. For some models in these two fam-
ilies, interestingly, the highest similarity scores rather correspond
to inter-family counterparts with matching embedding dimensions
than with models in the same family. Specifically, gte-small reports
the highest similarity to bge-small and gte-base to bge-base. On the
other hand, gte-large shows slightly higher similarity to bge-base
than bge-large and thus to a model with a lower embedding dimen-
sion. Another inter-family cluster is formed by the three models
with the highest CKA scores overall, namely UAE, mxbai and bge-
large, whose scores suggest almost perfect embedding similarity. In

Figure 3: Jaccard similarity over all 𝑘on NFCorpus, comparing bge-large (a) and gte-large (b) to all other models. While bge-large
shows high similarity to UAE-Large-v1 and mxbai-embed-large-v1, scores for gte-large are clustered much closer. Jaccard
similarity seems to be most unstable for small values of 𝑘, which would commonly be chosen for retrieval tasks.
fact, the similarity score of bge-large to these two models is much
higher than to other bge models.
Shifting our attention to top- 𝑘retrieval similarity, clusters vary
depending on the 𝑘value. Figure 3 illustrates how Jaccard similarity
evolves over 𝑘on NFCorpus. The first plot displays Jaccard scores
between bge-large and all other models, while the second plot
illustrates the scores for gte-large. For extremely low 𝑘, we observe
some peaks for nearly all models, followed by a noticeable drop
in similarity. Of course, for larger 𝑘, the scores converge to one.
Re-affirming our earlier observations with the CKA metric, bge-
large demonstrates high retrieval similarity with UAE and mxbai.
Similarity to the remaining models is much lower, with the highest
scores for bge-base and bge-small for larger 𝑘. However, especially
for small𝑘, there is high variance in similarity score, with models
from other families, e.g. Mistral or gte-large sometimes achieving
higher scores than the bge models. A similar pattern can also be
observed in the second plot, where Jaccard similarity for gte-large is
highest within its family for larger 𝑘, but models like mxbai or bge-
base sometimes reporting higher similarity for small 𝑘. Therefore,
the clusters we identified through our CKA analysis are only truly
reflected in these plots for large values of 𝑘. This suggest that in real-
world use cases, where the top- 𝑘are crucial, such representational
similarity measures might not provide the full picture. The plots
for other model families provide nearly identical insights as those
in the second plot in Figure 3 and thus we do not present them for
sake of brevity.For rank similarity, scores peak for small 𝑘and then quickly
start to drop until they approach a low stable score for larger 𝑘as
shown in Figure 2 for gte-large. Once again, the bge/UAE/mxbai
inter-family cluster shows the highest similarity. In contrast to
Jaccard similarity, the clusters that could be observed for CKA do
not always show for rank similarity. As can be seen in Figure 2,
the model with the highest rank similarity to gte-large is mxbai,
rather than another gte model. Even so, the previously observed
clusters also tend to appear for rank similarity, though they vary
more depending on the models and dataset. Generally, scores for
nearly all models are rather small for larger 𝑘, indicating low rank
similarity. For small 𝑘, results vary more and differences between
individual models are more pronounced.
As retrieval similarity at small 𝑘is of most interest from a prac-
tical perspective, we take a closer look at top-10 Jaccard similarity.
The heatmaps in Figures 4-6 show the top-10 Jaccard similarity
between models across datasets. A striking insight here is that even
the most similar models only report a Jaccard similarity of higher
than 0.6, with the majority less than 0.5. This is of great relevance
to practitioners, as it would imply that even using embeddings
from models that report high representational similarity scores
may yield little overlap in retrieved text chunks. As earlier, the
cluster of UAE/mxbai/bge-large is the most prominent one with
the highest scores. Intra-family scores tend to be the highest for
most models, i.e. t5 and OpenAI. Depending on the dataset, this also
applies to gte and e5 models, although Jaccard similarity to models
from other families is sometimes higher. We also note that for the

Figure 4: Jaccard (a) and rank similarity (b) for the top-10 retrieved text chunks averaged over 25 queries on NFCorpus. The
clusters vary slightly depending on the measure, as do the scores. Models tend to be most similar to models from their own
family. However, some inter-family clusters are visible as well.
two larger datasets FiQA-2018 and TREC-COVID, the similarity
scores are generally substantially lower, as can be seen in Figure
6. For the smaller datasets, Jaccard similarity is generally higher,
though results differ depending on the data (see Figures 4 and 5).
Similar observations can be made for rank similarity, although the
appearance of family clusters is more dependent on the dataset.
Larger datasets also lead to lower scores. These results illustrate
that while family clusters can still be perceived at small 𝑘, they are
not as prominent as they are for larger 𝑘. Furthermore, the top-10
retrieved results differ substantially for most models and datasets
and their similarity might be dependent on the dataset itself.
5.2 Open Source Alternatives to Proprietary
Models
We explicitly included proprietary models in our analysis to check
which open source models are the best - which in our case means
the most similar - alternative. The CKA scores in Figure 1 indicate
that embeddings generated by OpenAI’s models (text-embedding-
3-large/-small) are highly similar to those generated by Mistral,
while the Cohere model (embed-english-v3.0) demonstrates high
similarity to e5-large-v2.
These observations do not entirely extend to retrieval similarity,
especially for Cohere. While Mistral is still the most similar model
to OpenAI’s for larger 𝑘across all datasets, there is no consistently
most similar model for Cohere. Rather, the model varies depending
on the dataset and measure - Jaccard and rank similarity - sometimes
showing highest similarity to e5-large-v2, but sometimes also toother models like Mistral. Taking a closer look at top-10 similarity,
Mistral still largely exhibits the highest similarity to the OpenAI
models, especially to text-embedding-3-large. For text-embedding-
3-small, scores on all datasets are rather close to those of other
models. In absolute terms, however, retrieval similarity between
Mistral and OpenAI models is only low to moderate. On smaller
datasets, the highest Jaccard similarity to text-embedding-3-large
only reaches about 0.6(see Figure 5), while on TREC-COVID, the
largest dataset, Jaccard similarity goes down to merely 0.18(see
Figure 6). For Cohere’s model, the most similar model for top-10
Jaccard similarity is different for each dataset, with the highest
scores of 0.51occurring on ArguAna shwon in Figure 5. For all
proprietary models, even the best retrieval similarity at top-10
still suggests that the embeddings that would be presented to an
LLM can differ notably. Once again, we could also observe dataset-
dependent variance in scores, with lower retrieval similarity on
larger datasets.
6 DISCUSSION
While a pair-wise comparison of embeddings using CKA shows
intra- and inter-family model clusters, retrieval similarity over dif-
ferent𝑘offers a more nuanced picture. Especially for small 𝑘, which
are of most interest from a practical perspective, retrieval similarity
varies. When comparing the top-10 retrieved text chunks, the low
Jaccard similarity scores indicate little overlap in retrieved chunks,
even when CKA scores are high. Especially for the two larger
datasets FiQA-2018 and TREC-COVID, these scores are extremely

Figure 5: Jaccard similarity for the top-10 retrieved text chunks averaged over 25 queries on SciFact (a) and ArguAna (b). The
UAE and mxbai models show high levels of similarity along with bge-large. The remaining models tend to show the highest
similarity within their own family with the exception of the bge/gte inter-family cluster.
low. As RAG systems usually operate on millions of embeddings,
our datasets are comparatively small. Therefore, should a general
trend of larger datasets leading to lower retrieval similarity exist,
text chunks retrieved by different models in a regular use case might
be nearly distinct for small 𝑘. Overall, our results suggest that even
though embeddings seem rather similar when compared directly,
retrieval performance can still vary substantially, is most unsta-
ble for𝑘values that are commonly used in RAG systems and also
dataset-dependent. Retrieved text chunks at small 𝑘show the least
overlap, often leading to high differences in the data that would be
presented to an LLM as additional context.
Our analysis demonstrates that although models tend to be most
similar to models from their own family, inter-family clusters exist.
The most prominent of these clusters is formed by the models bge-
large-en-v1.5, UAE-Large-V1 and mxbai-embed-large-v1, which
demonstrate high similarity even for retrieval at low 𝑘. Never-
theless, the high variance of retrieval similarity of the remaining
clusters for small 𝑘means that while the identified clusters might
provide some measure of orientation when choosing an embedding
model, the choice still remains a non-trivial task. Identifying suit-
able alternatives to proprietary models is likewise not as simple.
While we were able to determine SFR-Embedding-Mistral as the
model being most similar to OpenAI’s embedding models, Jaccard
similarity at top-10 for larger datasets shows a low overlap in re-
trieved text chunks. Furthermore, for Cohere’s embedding model,
we were unable to find a single most similar model, as this model
varied across datasets for small 𝑘values.7 CONCLUSION
In this paper we evaluated the similarity of embedding models on
different datasets. Given the large number of available models, iden-
tifying clusters or families of models with similar embeddings can
simplify the model selection process. While previous work on LLM
similarity exists, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, it so far
lacks a clear focus on embedding models specifically in the context
of RAG. We therefore analyzed the similarity of embeddings gener-
ated by 19 different models using CKA for pairwise comparison as
well as Jaccard and rank similarity to compare retrieval behavior
at top-𝑘across five datasets. Comparing embeddings with CKA
generally showed intra- and inter-family clusters across datasets.
These clusters also appeared when evaluating top- 𝑘retrieval simi-
larity with large 𝑘values. However, scores for low 𝑘values, which
would commonly be chosen in RAG systems, show high variance
and much lower similarity, especially on larger datasets. Although
we were able to identify some model clusters, our results suggest
that choosing the optimal model remains a non-trivial task that
requires careful consideration.
Still, we argue that a better understanding of how similarly dif-
ferent embedding models behave is an important research topic
that requires further attention. There are a plethora of real-world
scenarios where RAG systems can potentially be deployed. One
such scenario, for example, is to retrieve relevant web content in re-
sponse to a query. As large corpora of such data are available in the
form of Web ARChive (WARC) files, evaluating embedding model
similarity on such large, uncleaned datasets would perhaps lead to
a better estimation of model similarity for a realistic RAG use case.

Figure 6: Jaccard similarity for the top-10 retrieved text chunks averaged over 25 queries on FiQA-2018 (a) and TREC-COVID
(b). Most models seem to retrieve almost completely distinct text chunks. Only the bge/UAE/mxbai cluster still shows a notable
level of similarity, while the scores of the remaining clusters indicate only moderate to low levels of similarity.
Additionally, as documents often need to be chunked into smaller
parts to fit into the models, the effect of chunking strategies such as
token-based or semantic chunking on embedding similarity could
be explored. Furthermore, our evaluation focused on a small sample
of similarity measures, with their own definition about which crite-
ria make models similar. Introducing more measures with different
perspectives could improve our understanding on which factors
influence model similarity. Finally, our focus was on identifying
clusters or families of models, which for our initial experiments led
us to choosing families of embedding models with varying perfor-
mance on MTEB. With the frequent appearance of new models on
the leaderboard and the focus on good MTEB performance, it would
be of interest to compare the best performing models on MTEB
and check if their relative difference in performance correlates with
how similar these models are.

    "## Paper Information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Title:** Don't Forget to Connect! Improving RAG with Graph-based Reranking  \n",
    "**Authors:** Jialin Dong (UCLA), Bahare Fatemi (Google Research), Bryan Perozzi (Google Research), Lin F. Yang (UCLA), Anton Tsitsulin (Google Research)  \n",
    "**Paper ID:** 2405.18414v1  \n",
    "**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18414  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduces **G-RAG**, a graph neural network-based reranker that improves Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by leveraging connections between documents and semantic information via Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. The key innovation is using document graphs where nodes represent documents and edges capture shared concepts, enabling better identification of relevant documents even when they have weak direct connections to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Contributions:\n",
    "1. **Document Graph Construction**: Build graphs connecting documents based on shared AMR concepts\n",
    "2. **GNN-based Reranking**: Use Graph Neural Networks to leverage document connections for better ranking\n",
    "3. **AMR Integration**: Strategic use of AMR shortest paths from \"question\" nodes to avoid computational overhead\n",
    "4. **New Evaluation Metrics**: MTRR and TMHits@10 to handle tied rankings from LLMs\n"

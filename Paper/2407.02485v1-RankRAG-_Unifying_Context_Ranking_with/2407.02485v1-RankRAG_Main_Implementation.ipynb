    "## 📄 Paper Information\n",
    "- **Title**: RankRAG: Unifying Context Ranking with Retrieval-Augmented Generation in LLMs\n",
    "- **Authors**: Yue Yu, Wei Ping, Zihan Liu, Boxin Wang, Jiaxuan You, Chao Zhang, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro\n",
    "- **Institutions**: Georgia Tech, NVIDIA\n",
    "- **arXiv**: [2407.02485v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02485)\n",
    "- **Publication Date**: July 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Paper Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "RankRAG proposes a novel instruction fine-tuning framework that trains a single LLM for both context ranking and answer generation in RAG systems. The key innovation is using the same LLM to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rank retrieved contexts** based on relevance to the query\n",
    "2. **Generate answers** using the top-k reranked contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Contributions:\n",
    "- Unified framework combining ranking and generation in one model\n",
    "- Outperforms ChatQA-1.5 and GPT-4 on multiple benchmarks\n",
    "- Effective with small fraction of ranking data in training blend\n",
    "- Strong generalization to new domains (e.g., biomedical)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Problem Addressed:\n",
    "- **Retriever limitations**: Dense retrievers struggle with relevance estimation\n",
    "- **Context selection trade-off**: Too few contexts → low recall; too many → noise\n",
    "- **Separate ranking models**: Limited generalization capability\n",

    "\n",
    "### Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the paper, RankRAG consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stage-I: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**\n",
    "   - General instruction following datasets\n",
    "   - Conversational data, long-form QA, synthetic instructions\n",
    "   - 128K examples total\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stage-II: RankRAG Instruction-Tuning**\n",
    "   - Reading comprehension tasks\n",
    "   - Retrieval-augmented QA\n",
    "   - Context ranking tasks (MS MARCO)\n",
    "   - Synthetic conversation data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't have access to the exact fine-tuned models, we'll implement:\n",
    "1. **Simulated RankRAG**: Using prompting techniques to mimic the dual ranking-generation behavior\n",
    "2. **Evaluation Framework**: Using DeepEval for comprehensive assessment\n",
    "3. **Comparison Baselines**: Standard RAG vs RankRAG approach"
